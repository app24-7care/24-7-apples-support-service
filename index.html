            <p class="pragraph">Every time Apple releases a new iOS update, they introduce new features, bug fixes, security patches, and other optimizations. So, updating your iPhone regularly will actually make it faster and more secure. Here’s how to update your iPhone manually and automatically, and what to do when your iPhone won’t update properly.

            </p>
            <h1>How to Update Your iPhone Manually
            </h1>
            <p>To update your iPhone manually, open the Settings app and go to General > Software Update > Download and Install. Then enter the passcode that you use to sign in to your iPhone. Finally, tap Agree and wait for your iPhone to update and restart.  

            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>Note: Before you begin updating your iPhone, make sure that you have a strong, reliable WiFi connection. It is also recommended that you plug your iPhone into a power source and back up all your important data first.

                </p>
                
            </div>
            <p>1-Open the Settings app on your iPhone. If you can’t find any app on your iPhone, you can always go to the home screen and swipe down from the middle of the screen. Then use the on-screen keyboard to search for Settings.</p>
            <p>2-Then tap General.</p>

                <p>3-Next, select Software Update. It could take a few minutes for your iPhone to check for available updates.</p>
                <p>4-Then, tap Download and Install or Update Now. If you don’t see this option, your iPhone might be up to date. If you have automatic updates enabled, your iPhone might start downloading and installing the update at this stage.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p>Note: From here, you can also choose to update to a beta version of iOS to get the newest features before they are released to the public. However, you first need to sign up through the Apple beta program and enroll your device.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p> 6- Finally, wait for your iPhone to update and restart. Once your iPhone restarts, you will have to enter your iPhone’s passcode again.</p>
         
               <div class="note">
                <p>Note: If you are updating to the latest version of iOS, your iPhone will automatically restart after the update has been installed. However, if you have an older iPhone, and you have not updated in a while, there’s a chance you will need to agree to terms and conditions.</p>

                <div class="note">
